            Below are some of the great views that club members have captured on
            film (or digital memory!) on various dive trips.

              This turtle was spotted swimming around the Great Barrier Reef
              (Queensland, Australia) quite gracefully despite having had a
              large chunk taken out of its right side, presumably in a shark
              attack. <span>[Photographer: Ian Lloyd]</span>

              Jill was just snorkelling when she took this picture - the
              jellyfish was only a couple of feet under the surface, hence the
              light is excellent. Jill assures us that the jellyfish hadno
              "nasty, stingy, dangly bits"!

              in Fiji.<span>[Photographer: Paul Spencer]</span>
